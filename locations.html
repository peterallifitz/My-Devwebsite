                    ( RAF TANGMERE ).... 1 June 1950: A Gloster Meteor at RAF Tangmere passes a flying saucer lit up with lights; this was described as 'Britain's first flying saucer'. The object was reported to be shining, revolving, and disc-like at 20,000 ft at 14.30, flying eastwards over the Portsmouth area. RAF Tangmere asked the radar station at RAF Wartling in Sussex if it had seen the object, and it had on its PPI screen. It led to the setting up of the Flying Saucer Working Party.
